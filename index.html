               <h3>Biography</h3>
               <p><em><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong> Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister 
                   at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he 
                   enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
                    politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose
                     to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades 
                     of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah 
                     advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between
                      the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become
                       prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and 
                       proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the 
                       political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, 
                       Jinnah resigned from the Congress when 
                      greed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
                By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should 
                have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain 
                in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by
                 Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian
                  Muslims. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while
                   leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections 
                   held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims.
                    Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a
                     power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British India 
                     to be united as a single state following independence, leading all 
                     parties to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu 
                     India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
                As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah 
                worked to establish the new nation's government and policies,
                 and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated
                  from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two states' 
                  independence, personally supervising the establishment of 
                  refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just
                   over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom.
                    He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets,
                     roads and localities in the world are named after
                    Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear
                     Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah
                      remains Pakistan's greatest leader.</em></p>
